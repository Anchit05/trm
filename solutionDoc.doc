1.) User story(Wei to Eth)

Solution:

- First checked the links provided and looked for the conversion from Wei to Eth
- Then checked the documentation of BigNumber.js and found the methods that can useful
- After analysing the component then checked how the addresses data is coming, as in the 
  addresses data the object was coming in array of objects form where object has 'address' and 
  'balance' keys.
- So, thought of formatting the balance key, in the addresses data. For that created a weiToEther
  function which will take care of the conversion. Create a helper file and put that function There
  so that it can be used, anywhere in the project.
